# Lab 27: Plotting and Images
##### April 13, 2020
---

Today we'd like to make sure we have practice creating different types of Matplotlib plots and assigning values labels to those plots. Learning objectives will include:
- [ ] Creating basic figure and axes objects
- [ ] Adding a bar and pie chart to an axes
- [ ] Modifying properties of plots

In addition, if you get lost or can not figure out some of the options available to you, have a look at the official documentation [here](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html), which has everything you could possibly need!

## Instructions

Suppose I have collected the following data on the number of labs we have had each month:

| Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 10 | 8 | 5 |

I'd like to present this data using two different types of plot: a bar plot and a pie chart. Put both in the same figure using side-by-side axes. Make sure both are fully annotated with axis labels and a title. In addition, determine some method to make the data from the current month stand out in some way.
